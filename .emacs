;; More performant rapid scrolling over unfontified regions. May cause brief
;; spells of inaccurate syntax highlighting right after scrolling, which should
;; quickly self-correct.
(setq fast-but-imprecise-scrolling t)

;; Don't ping things that look like domain names.
(setq ffap-machine-p-known 'reject)

;; Resizing the Emacs frame can be a terribly expensive part of changing the

;; fonts that are larger than the system default (which would resize the frame).

;; Emacs "updates" its ui more often than it needs to, so slow it down slightly
(setq idle-update-delay 1.0)  ; default is 0.5

;; Font compacting can be terribly expensive, especially for rendering icon
;; fonts on Windows. Whether disabling it has a notable affect on Linux and Mac
;; hasn't been determined, but do it there anyway, just in case. This increases
;; memory usage, however!
