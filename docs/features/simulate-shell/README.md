# Simulate Shell
> Completely simulate shell behaviors, make better user 
experience when using shell in Emacs.

The key bindings using shell in Emacs isn't the same as 
normal shell outside of Emacs. Just a few tweaks to make 
the shell inside the Emacs act the same way. Including 
some commands like `exit`, `cls`, `clear` etc.
