# Visualize - Undo/Reo
> Improved the user experience on undoing and redoing by 
showing the `undo-tree-visualizer` at the other window.

By having the `undo-tree-visualizer` you can easily see 
the undo/redo history. The tree will only be shown when 
you are undoing or redoing. Once you `type something`, `save 
the file` or `kill the buffer` the tree will be gone.
