**Q:** How do you open file?

**A:** I open file by hitting `M-f` which starts `counsel` with `ivy`. You are able to navigate the directory by selecting
the directory in minibuffer and hit return to navigate to the one level deeper to the directory tree. And hit `<backspace>`
to navigate one level back from the directory tree. Once you find the file you want to open, just hit return then the file
should open as exptected.

**Q:** How do you save the file?

**A:** Hit `C-s` like other editor. `C-s` will do some magic before saving, like untabify/tabify corresponding to the file type

## Navigation

---

**Q:** How do you navigate through file?

**A:** I use `C-<up>` and `C-<down>` to go to the next/previous blank line. Then use `C-<left>` and `C-<right>` to navigate
between words/symbols.

---

## Search & Replace

---

**Q:** How do you search for word?

**A:** There 3 major ways to do this.

**Method 1:** My first option is by hitting `C-f` and type out the word I'm looking for for just inside the
current file. If I am searching through the while project I use `C-F` to trigger `isearch-project` which incremental
search through the whole project.

Otherwise, to fastest way to search is to navigate the cursor to the position on top of the word I want, then call 
`C-,` or `C-.` to trigger incremental search at point. For the whole project, use `C-<` and `C->` instead.

**Method 2:** My second option is using [ivy-searcher](https://github.com/jcs-elpa/ivy-searcher) that powered by a pure 
elisp [searcher](https://github.com/jcs-elpa/searcher).

**Method 3:** My last option is using `counsel` package that uses 3rd party software like `grep`, `ag`, `rg`, etc.
Then the whole of the search result will be place inside ivy minibuffer window!
